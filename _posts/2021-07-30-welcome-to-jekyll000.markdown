Decide which of the following are valid proofs of the following statement:
If ab is an even number, then a or b is even.
Suppose a and b are odd. That is, a = 2k + 1 and b = 2m + 1 for some integers k and m . Then
    ab = (2k + 1) (2m + 1)
    = 4km + 2k + 2m + 1
    = 2(2km + k + m) + 1.
Therefore ab is odd.
{% endhighlight %}

In order to prove its true we have to assume ab is even and a or b has to be even. However the proof start off with a or b being odd and proving ab is odd by the end since the statement is ab is even. Meaning this proof just even possible so its not valid!
