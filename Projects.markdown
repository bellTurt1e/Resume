These projects will introduce you to number systems, bases, sets, and Boolean algebra; as well as functions, relations, and induction. By using these methods I’ve learned how challenging a simplistic problem can actually be. Since every problem can be approached and solved in multiple ways, it's important to consider what's the most efficient way to solve a problem. By using discrete mathematics and determining the most efficient means of approaching a problem I’m able to approach any problem in the most time efficient way through this course.

The biggest challenge in this course thus far for me has been learning binomials. When looking at a single chest piece at first glance what I imagine is how the piece can actually move. When the average person moves a chest piece they don't consider all of the ways it can move to that location. An example being a rook that wants to move from its starting position no matter where it moves it follows Pascal’s triangle. All pieces essentially follow the Pascal triangle! The farther a piece moves the more possibilities it has in terms of pathing to get there.

Some major key points to take away from what I've learned is to always think about the list of outcomes that come from a single problem. No problem has to be approached in a linear fashion. If a selection is made or there can’t be any repeats it's important to consider combinations and permutations. With combinations and permutations we can form subsets moreover from subsets we can form along with possibilities and amount of outcomes. As stated before every problem can be solved in multiple ways but it's most important to solve a problem the most efficient way using binomials.
